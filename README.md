# Data
This data was pulled from https://data.wa.gov/Procurements-and-Contracts/Statewide-Contract-Master-Contract-Sales-Data-by-C/n8q6-4twj/about_data and is updated quarterly; it was most recently updated in April 2024. The data was aggregated in Excel prior to being loaded into SSMS for report write ups.


# Goals
Complete exploratory data analysis to present KPIs to stakeholders, as well as determine how contract sales growth for diverse and small owned businesses compared to overall contract sales. (For our purposes, the term "diverse business" is when a business is labeled: as being registered with the Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises, Veteran owned, a small business, or as a diverse option from the given dataset.)

# Key Takeaways
- There has been a steady incline of contract sales growth from 2015 - 2020 when the pandemic caused a decline to both. Since 2020, contracts numbers and sales have both recovered and hit an all time high in **2023 with over $2 billion worth of contract sales**. Aside from the pandemic era, we have noticed a trend in having the **most sales done in Quarter 2** throughout the year.

- Ever since 2015, U.S. Bank has been the dominant vendor for overall contract sales, often more than doubling the runner ups for most amount of contract sales. However, while **U.S. Bank has had the most contract sales every year**, it only recently claimed the most amount of contracts out of all other vendors in 2023, beating out **Verizon Wireless who maintained the most amount of contracts from 2015 - 2022**. 

- Finally, we see that while contract counts have slightly declined since 2015, the **number of contracts that are held by diverse businesses has increased by almost 175%**. Additionally, while total contract sales have increased by more than 160%, the total contract **sales held by diverse businesses has increased by over 500%**. This means that diverse businesses have been growing, and have been greatly increasing spending on contracts.
